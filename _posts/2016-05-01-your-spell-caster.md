# Your Spell Caster

**My name is Talia Felix.** I'm the one running this little one-woman show. I believe that anyone can do spells and [I even write books][0] about how you can cast your own spells and rituals. I also perform spells for hire for those who need it.

I've been offering spiritual services online since 2008 when I started my first website,**Talia's Tarot**. Later, when I began offering spells, I moved the domain over to**The Lucky Temple**. Now I have changed domains again and operate the more descriptively named **[Hoodoo Online.][1]**

**Books By Talia Felix:**[Death and Destruction][2], [Conjure Cookbook][3], [Conjurin' Ole Time][4], [The Hand Book][5], [The Intranquil Spirit][6], [The Hoodoo Book of Dreams][7], [Homemade Hoodoo][8]

# Using scientific testing, Talia's magic spells are as effective as anyone else's!

Am I being cute when I say this? Yes I am. But here's the thing -- no amount of money is worth dealing with a person who genuinely believes I can turn a person into a toad or make money fall out of the sky. I am not trying to scam anyone, I don't want people to _feel_ scammed because they asked me for something impossible, and so I really go out of my way to chase off those who have "excessive faith" in magic. [My FAQ][9] is there so I don't have to spend a lot of one-on-one time unselling my services to people. If you are looking for magic spells based on _Dungeons and Dragons _or _Harry Potter,_ please go elsewhere. If you are looking for African Vodun or Haitian Voodoo, go elsewhere since those are not what I practice. _We must have compatible expectations if we're to work together happily!_

Many people are happy with the results of hoodoo magic spells, and feel that such magic has helped them to achieve things they otherwise could have never accomplished. This does not mean it will do anything and everything, and do please keep in mind that if these things were 100% reliable I could happily charge several thousand or even millions of dollars for the exact same work I currently do for a few hundred. Magic is unreliable. So make sure at least you have a spellcaster you can trust.

Since this is a solo operation and Talia works together with you to ensure each spell will suit your needs, you [must email Talia to consult about a spellcast.][10]
