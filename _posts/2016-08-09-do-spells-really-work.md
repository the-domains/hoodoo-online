# Do Spells Really Work? 

Those who have never purchased a spell before often have this one great question on their minds: Do Spells Really Work? It seems silly perhaps that one would be looking into buying spells while being unsure if they even truly work or not, but many people hear whispered rumors or glowing assurances from friends that magic has succeeded in some fashion, and despite a lifetime of being told that magic is impossible or it's all just superstition, they come peeking into this potential new world full of hope and happiness. 

Unfortunately, in such cases where you don't have a background in magic or beliving in magic, there is a frequent tendency to have excessively high hopes that are based on what you've seen in movies or heard in fairytales. A lot of people who say that magic isn't real believe that "magic" means something even I wouldn't claim is real, either -- and I absolutely believe magic is real! 

I practice hoodoo --- a form of folk magic, famed as superstition. It's got more in common with those lucky rabbit's feet you find at the gas station than it does with anything seen in a _Harry Potter_ film. I spend a lot of my time _unselling_ people on my spells in order to avoid gaining customers with inappropriate expectations about spell casts. 

For a genuine magician/witch/mage/etc., casting a spell is something like trying to aim an arrow at an invisible target --- even if you've hit it, it can be hard to convince anyone else of the victory. This is part of why most real practitioners of the ancient art of magic, stuck in this modern age of "customer satisfaction", hesitate to make guarantees of success to their spell-seeking customers. I've known many people that perform spells are left to complain about having done successful rituals, but found clients were still unhappy because some element didn't play out according to expectations -- the spell worked but didn't happen as fast as they wanted, or they got more money/love/success but not as much more as they wanted. We must remember that magic is considered to be scientifically unproven. One reason it is bestowed with this status is because we cannot really view the alternate timeline wherein the spell wasn't cast --- which is just about the only way we would be able to prove what the magic did or didn't do. If a man casts a good luck spell, and two weeks later his car breaks down, does that mean the spell failed? Or might it be that the car's being in the shop saved him from a worse misfortune, like a serious accident, and consequently it is good luck that his car was in the shop? There's no way to compare situations to see the "what if" other than by using even more scientifically unproven techniques such as tarot cards and I Ching. 

Spells meant to influence someone else can be even harder to judge since we might not be privy to any changes in the subject's behavior. We might even see only behavior that seems like the opposite of what we wanted, and so assume failure of a spell that actually had been a success. For example: I knew a woman who had a love spell put on her by a man that she hated. She hated every moment she spent with him, but when they were apart she couldn't seem to get him off her mind, and always was willing and anxious to see him again. She eventually figured out that he'd put a spell on her, and she took steps to remove the magic. After that, she didn't speak to him anymore. The man might well have assumed that his spell didn't work, since all he'd have seen was a woman who could barely stand him and who ultimately severed all contact with him. He wouldn't have known just how well his magic worked. 

The point of all this is a reminder to keep reasonable expectations when it comes to the practice of magic. It's not a practice that's about a lot of concrete Yes and No information. It's more art than science, and many of its powers remain mysterious due to their blurring of all that which is natural. Everyone wants magic spells that work; but what can you do when the "success" of a spell is such a subjective matter? In effect, any time a person wants a spell to gain "more" of something, it is impossible to promise how much "more" one will get. One can always have "more" and still find it lacking. This can be proved just by looking at all those "poor rich men" who have more money than they know what to do with yet still work and compete to gain more. With magic, even when we get what we want... we may find that we want it again. 

So why use magic if it can't be proven? 

Well, that's up to you. Religion cannot be proven either, but many people find benefits from practicing and believing in one. Generally, these people also do understand that there are limitations on what can be achieved through religion -- for example, only the most fanatical will believe that religion is suitable as a replacement for medical treatment, or that faith without any action on their part is going to see their prayers answered. (An example of action: if you pray for a job, and the next day you see a listing for a suitable job, you would need to apply for the job in order to have a shot at seeing your prayer answered. You are not going to inexplicably _have _the job, even if it is theoretically within God's power to make that happen.) 

To the fanatics, the news that one's beliefs are too extreme is not welcome. Most magic fanatics are not happy to hear the news either. Pointing out the errors in their beliefs and expectations just gets a bunch of arguments that seem to be based on the lies told by spiritual scammers. ("But some people do it because they like to give back to others!" And that's why they advertise online for business and charge money for this? "They just charge because in magic, you have to give something first in order to get back!" Well, if you believe these stories, go hire the guy who told you all that to cast your spell. "I can't, he moved away and I don't know where to find him now." Probably because he's running from the police for scamming people!) 

With any service-based purchase it is your job to be clear on what you are buying before you buy it. [The FAQ, as well as several other pages on this site][0], strive to make it absolutely clear that there are no guarantees that your magic spell will "work" in some specific way. I promise to cast your spell according to traditional methods -- what results if any will be produced by that casting are not in my control after that. 

The good news is that spells have been known to produce many happy surprises and exciting results! It's just a matter of keeping a realistic perspective: a perspective where you can realize that one is participating in something many people see as inherently unrealistic, and that just "believing more" isn't going to produce better results. A healthy skepticism is a very good thing, and will protect against being scammed or misled. At the same time, one cannot expect to receive concrete answers to a question like "will it work?" when even medical doctors and attorneys cannot make those kinds of promises about their jobs. The definition of success relies on the individual, and having a sensible expectation about what's possible through magic will ensure that one can get more out of spellcasts. 

Is it more enough? That's up to you. If there is sufficient potential despite the uncertainty, [please click here to visit the Hoodoo Spells Page for more information.][1]
