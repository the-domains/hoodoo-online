# When subjected to scientific testing, Talia is as good a spell caster as any other you can find!

If you are looking for magic spells based on Dungeons and Dragons or Harry Potter, please go elsewhere. Only those interested in the genuine benefits of real world magic will be served by the powers of hoodoo and folk magic.

Magic is not waving a wand and then getting what you want. It's not a vending machine where you drop in your coins and your wish falls out. _It is a spiritual process whereby the very powers of the universe are harnessed towards the gaining of your goal._

Talia Felix is the one running this little one-woman show. She was accused of being a witch long before she actually ever practiced any sort of witchcraft. Some people have said it was because have a heightened sensitivity to witches and spiritual forces. Ultimately, Talia was called to the profession of a spellcaster in a real way that few people can claim --- not because she wanted to take the work, but _because the Universe compelled her to do it._

Talia, herself, believes that _anyone_ can learn to do spells, and [she writes books about how you can cast your own spells and rituals][0]. Her knowledge of magic developed out of a deep interest in history combining with an interest in homemade this-and-that. Eventually beauty recipes turned to folk remedies, and then to occult rituals. Soon she knew enough to begin writing books on the subject. Her titles include_[Conjurin' Ole Time][1], [The Conjure Cookbook][2], [The Hand Book][3]_ and others.

There are many people who have requested Talia to perform spells on their behalf. Talia has even performed magic spells on celebrities! She has been happy with the results of spells that include money-drawing work, love spells, communication spells, spiritual cleansing and healing, magical protection, magical influence, law keep away, attraction spells, revenge spells and enhancement of good luck. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b64460d-3755-4588-b90e-f436d20cd901.jpg)
