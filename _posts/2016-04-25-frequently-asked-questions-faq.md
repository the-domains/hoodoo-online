# Q: Is the spell guaranteed to work?

A: I guarantee to do work if hired; but were magic reliable, it wouldn't be considered magic; it would be science. All magic is by its nature unreliable. I'm not trying to scam anyone, and I will turn down customers if I think the spell they want has no chance of working. If I take your case then I think there's some chance of success; but medical doctors, scientists and psychiatrists don't guarantee their work will succeed, and neither can I. So, I make no promises whatsoever about what results, if any, will be produced by the spells I offer. Many people are pleased with the results of hoodoo magic spells, but there can be no guarantee. You're hiring me to guarantee my service. All I can promise is my action, not my effect.

# Q: How long will it take to see results?

A: The genuine answer is: no one really knows. There's no scientific method for determining this, because it's not science. For most cases, I find that a successful spell will show results within about 1 month, but there are some spells where it's a lot more variable. In general, spells which affect you alone will be faster than spells which need to influence other people in the world around you. In my experience, being anxious and demanding of fast results tends to work counterproductively. Most spells where you need results super fast will just fail due to the negativity this sort of mindset conjures forth or by creating too much limitation on the spell's ability to manifest. Best results are usually found if you can have your spell cast and then FORGET ABOUT IT, putting no more concern into the matter.

# Q: What is your success rate?

A: Hired spells are difficult to interpret, and I discourage clients from updating me about success rates, as it puts them into an improper mindset of waiting to see results (see previous question) and also causes them to discuss the spells, which is another no-no in the world of magic. I can honestly say that I hear more good reports than I do bad reports, and in a survey of 80 customers, 76 of them were satisfied with their spellcast purchases (which makes for a 95% satisfaction rate.) Intent does matter, and _spells for personal change or gain_ will succeed more often than other kinds of magic.

# Q: What kind of spell should I get for \[fill in the blank\]?

A: I recommend you get the best spell that you can afford. Hoodoo Spells have their strength increased by each additional day of work. I do not recommend "saving up" for a spell you can't afford or spending your last penny on a spell.

# Q: Will you cast a spell for free?/Can I pay you after the spell is cast?

A: No. If you can't afford spellwork, then it is a sign that now is not the time for you to be using hired help to cast spells. Spells are not necessities and there are many people who get through life just fine without ever using spellwork.

# Q: Will the spell be permanent?

A: Most spells I cast are designed to produce an event or an effect. Certainly, if the spell is successful, the event it caused will never fail to have been produced; however, time isn't going to simply stop after it is cast, and what actions you take after the spell's effect is in place have the power to maintain or destroy its influence. For example, if a spell is cast to make you get a particular job, you might get the job; but if you're bad at the job, you still can get yourself fired. This would not mean the spell "wore off" or "wasn't permanent" but rather that the actions you took after the spellcast were not in harmony with maintaining it. In short, for a hoodoo spell's effect to last you need to take action to maintain it, either in practical real-life ways, or if that is not possible, by frequent use of related magic. The SPELL is permanent but the created actions might not be.

# Q: Will the spell backfire or come back onto me in any way?

A: This is a belief based question. I don't believe in magic backfiring; but if you do, then this answer is up to you to decide.

# Q: Do you have a phone number or Skype where I can reach you?

A: No, all contact is through email only. I prefer this for several reasons including that it spares me from having to rush my answers and it ensures I don't get interrupted by ringing phones or Skype melodies while I'm busy casting your spells. This is a one-woman business and the number of inquiries I get far exceed the amount of paid work I actually take, so it is not practical for me to have phones or other live-chat options available.

# Q: What is your email address for contact?

A: **[TaliasTarot@gmail.com][0]**
