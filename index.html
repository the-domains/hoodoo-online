Witches were said to shapeshift or to send spirits or demons to torment their selected victims. And yet, the medicine and folk practices of the time, which were considered to be acceptable work, often used elements like herbs, prayers, symbolism; and even the medicine of the educated still relied on planetary correspondences and ideas about balancing bodily “humours.” This was sometimes known as “Natural Magic” (as opposed to unholy or unnatural magic that it was believed devil-worshippers could use) and was considered equivalent to what would eventually become known as “science.” </p></div></div></div><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-2  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="68"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px max-w-768px p-1 color-title" data-reactid="69"><!-- react-empty: 70 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="71"><h1 data-reactid="72"><span class="" data-reactid="73"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="74">BIBLIOGRAPHY </a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 75 --><!-- react-empty: 76 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="77"><p data-reactid="78"> Those who have never purchased a spell before often have this one great question on their minds: Do Spells Really Work? It seems silly perhaps that one would be looking into buying spells while being unsure if they even truly work or not, but many people hear whispered rumors or glowing assurances from friends that magic has succeeded in some fashion, and despite a lifetime of being told that magic is impossible or it’s all just superstition, they come peeking into this potential new world full of hope and happiness. </p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="79"><p data-reactid="80"> Unfortunately, in such cases where you don’t have a background in magic or beliving in magic, there is a frequent tendency to have excessively high hopes that are based on what you’ve seen in movies or heard in fairytales. A lot of people who say that magic isn’t real believe that “magic” means something even I wouldn’t claim is real, either – and I absolutely believe magic is real! </p></div></div></div></section><section id="5" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="81"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="82"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="83"><!-- react-empty: 84 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="85"><h1 data-reactid="86"><span class="" data-reactid="87"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="88">Your Spell Caster</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 89 --><!-- react-empty: 90 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="91"><p data-reactid="92">My name is Talia Felix.

Why not Wicca or something more mainstream? As it fell, in my teens and early twenties I was a little interested in magic as a concept, but most of the available materials were about Wicca, New Age or Ceremonial magic, and none of these appealed to me in the least: Wicca tended to be too restrictive in what was &quot;allowed&quot; to be done, New Age was too focused on self-improvement, and Ceremonial was ridiculously complicated and required too many expensive tools. There is virtually no recent family history of magical practice (the scandal of my great-grandfather and his &quot;Satanic&quot; lodestone aside) so I had to work with what I could learn from books or websites. I didn&#x27;t fret much about not being able to practice magic, but it happened in about 2006 that I was shopping online for a favorite scented soap of mine, and discovered that one of the retailers selling it specialized in hoodoo supplies. I knew very little about hoodoo, but this made me interested in learning more about it -- and once I began learning it, I realized it was the magic for me. It was the first magic that ever made any sense at all! I buried myself into the study of it, learning the techniques and the logic of it, and the traditions on has to abide. Everything was so perfectly sensible! I studied it very devoutly -- obsessively, even -- and read everything I could get my hands on, then eventually, I started knowing a bit about it. And that led other people knowing I knew about it; which led to people asking me to perform spells on their behalf... it appeared that it was time to give in to what was destined for me instead of fighting it. According to tradition, those who are destined to become professional hoodoo practitioners will fail at any other attempted career because it&#x27;s their inescapable destiny to have to be hoodoo practitioners. It seems it&#x27;s correct, because here we are.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="95"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="96"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="97"><!-- react-empty: 98 --><!-- react-empty: 99 --><!-- react-empty: 100 --><!-- react-empty: 101 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="102"><p data-reactid="103">SPELL PRICE: </p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="104"><p data-reactid="105">3x strength: $250 (basic) </p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="7" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="106"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="107"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="108"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="109"><span data-reactid="110"><!-- react-empty: 111 --><h2 data-reactid="112"><a data-reactid="113">Hoodoo Online</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="114"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="115"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="116"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="117"></div></section></div></div>
